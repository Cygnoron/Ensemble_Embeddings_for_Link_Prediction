Old sampling process:
The old sampling process didn't take into account, that when sampling an entity_id and adding a corresponding triple_id, the other connected entity_id is also giong to be present in the subgraph.
-> sample: entity_id=3
-> triple_id: (head, relation, tail)_id = (3, 0, 5)_id
-> add triple_id to delta
-> entities 3 and 5 present in subgraph

New sampling process:
The new sampling process first samples an entity_id, and then compares the triple_ids for that entity, if head or tail entity_id are already present in the set of sampled entities. If either head or tail entity were found, the triple_id is added to delta, otherwise proceed to the next triple_id. AFTER adding the triple_id to delta, the entity_id itself is added to the set of sampled entities, and also removed from the entities_ids_unused set as well as the entity_set.
-> sample: entity_id=3
-> triple_id: (head, relation, tail)_id = (3, 0, 5)_id
	-> if 5 in sampled_entities:
		add triple_id to delta
	-> else:
		do nothing
-> add 3 to sampled_entities
